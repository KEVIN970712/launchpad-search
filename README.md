Launchpad Search can replace your digital assistant and give you full control over your search queries. If you prefer to keep your current assistant, you can still enjoy Launchpad by adding a home screen shortcut or a Quick Setting Tile.<br><br>

Never leave your apps; get your tasks done with just a floating window that does it all for you without ever closing the one you're already in.b
